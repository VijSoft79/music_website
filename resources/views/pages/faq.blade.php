                    <p>Yes. We are here to support artists and their music. If you reach out to a musician we ask that a free offering is included, this can be an addition to your Spotify playlist or shout out on social media but it is up to you.

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>At You Hear Us we do not take a cut of the money you are charging the artists for their chosen exposure. We urge you to offer exposure at a lower price point as you are keeping 100% of that money. We allow you to pick the artists and songs you want to feature. We left the search up to the curators as we feel this is the most convenient way for the curator to access artists without overwhelming inboxes.
